Map coloring of Iranian provinces using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with Python.

# Iran Map Coloring using CSP

This project solves the map coloring problem of Iranian provinces using a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** approach implemented in **Python**. The goal is to assign colors to provinces such that no neighboring provinces share the same color, using a limited number of colors.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Python implementation using backtracking and forward checking
- Graph-based representation of provinces and their neighbors
- Visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib
- Constraint handling with limited color options

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Given a simplified map of Iran with neighboring provinces, assign one of four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) to each province. Neighboring provinces must have different colors. This is modeled and solved as a classical CSP.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iran-map-coloring-csp.git
